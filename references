The project has been written from the scratch. There is no copy-pasted 
parts of any other existing project. However during development I was 
using several interesting resources which could have major influence on 
my source code. Such resources will be listed here.

In this document I will put all resources containing source code which were
used during development or which were used as an example/base for further 
development.
